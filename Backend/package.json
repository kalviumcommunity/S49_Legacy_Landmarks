  "description": "ASAP project is about the best historic places to visit in the world and the name of the project is Legacy Landmarks. The idea behind this project is:\r Users have to create an account after which they will be directed to the main page.\r Users can see and search all the historic places that they want to visit or want to know about.\r When the user clicks on the historic place they will get to know about the place, its past, old and famous monuments, about the people and their culture.\r User will also get the best and shortest way of transport to that place.\r I came across this project through my hobby. I love to visit and discover historic places and there might be people who want to visit and discover but they are unable to do so.\r asdfgbhnm,",
